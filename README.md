# Universal Paperclips Solver

This short script beats "Universal Paperclips" in around two hours, without human intervention or predetermined seeds.

The script only gathers information and interacts with the game via the DOM elements a human player could see. It does not "cheat" by calling public variables from the game.

Functionalities include:

- Calculating and setting the best price for paperclips.
- Always selecting the winner of strategic modelling tourneys, by counting points as they happen.
- Analyzing frames from the battle canvas.
- Buying clippers, using trust, investing, building factories and drones, etc.

To use, ideally [reset a new game](https://universalpaperclips.gamepedia.com/Resetting_the_game) before copying the code in the browser's console.
